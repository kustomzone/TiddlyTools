|Description|display tabbed discussion summary with comment input form|
!!!!!Documentation
&gt;see [[DiscussionPluginInfo]]
!!!!!Configuration
&lt;&lt;&lt;
When installed, [[DiscussionPlugin]] can automatically modify the default shadow [[ViewTemplate]] so that all tiddlers will be rendered with two tabs: &quot;Page&quot;, and &quot;Discussion&quot;.  The &quot;Page&quot; tab displays the regular tiddler content, while the &quot;Discussion&quot; tab displays the summary list of comments as well as an input form to enter new comments.  You can enable/disable this action by setting/clearing the following checkbox:
&gt;&lt;&lt;option chkDiscussionTemplate&gt;&gt; Automatically modify default shadow [[ViewTemplate]]
Note: //''You must reload your document for changes to this option to take effect.''//  In addition, this option is only applied to the shadow [[ViewTemplate]].  If you are using a custom [[ViewTemplate]], you will need to manually alter that template to add the Page and Discussion tab display.

''Please see [[DiscussionPluginInfo]] for additional configuration options and instructions.''
&lt;&lt;&lt;

2010.03.11 1.5.8 added &quot;about TiddlerName&quot; to &quot;There are # comments&quot; msg

|Description|select and display FAQ tiddlers from a droplist, sorted by date|
!!!!!Usage
&lt;&lt;&lt;
{{{&lt;&lt;faqViewer startwith:TiddlerName tagname classname sortby dateformat&gt;&gt;}}}
where:
*''startwith:TiddlerName'' (optional)&lt;br&gt;
*''tagname'' (optional)&lt;br&gt;specifies the set of tiddlers to include in the FAQ list (default='faq')
*''classname'' (optional)&lt;br&gt;specifies a CSS class to be applied surrounding the FAQ tiddler content
*''sortby'' (optional)&lt;br&gt;specifies the name of a tiddler field to sort by.  Use '+' or '-' as a prefix on the fieldname to indicate ascending or descending order, respectively (default='-modified').  You can also use the special keyword, ''Description'', to sort alphabetically based on the value of a slice named 'Description', that can be defined in each FAQ tiddler.  Note: if a particular FAQ tiddler has no description slice, the title of the tiddler is used as a fallback.
*''dateformat'' (optional)&lt;br&gt;specifies the formatting for dates displayed in the list.  Use &quot; &quot; (a single space) to suppress the date display.
examples:
{{{&lt;&lt;faqViewer&gt;&gt;}}}
{{smallform small{&lt;&lt;faqViewer&gt;&gt;}}}
{{{&lt;&lt;faqViewer package outline +title &quot; &quot;&gt;&gt;}}}
{{smallform small{&lt;&lt;faqViewer package outline +title &quot; &quot;&gt;&gt;}}}

|Description|view any tiddler by entering it's title - displays list of possible matches|
''View a tiddler by typing its title and pressing //enter//.''  As you type, a list of possible matches is displayed.  You can scroll-and-click (or use arrows+enter) to select/view a tiddler, or press escape to close the listbox to resume typing.  When the listbox is not displayed, pressing //escape// clears the current input.
!!!Documentation
&gt;see [[GotoPluginInfo]]
!!!Configuration
&lt;&lt;&lt;
*Match titles only after {{twochar{&lt;&lt;option txtIncrementalSearchMin&gt;&gt;}}} or more characters are entered.&lt;br&gt;Use down-arrow to start matching with shorter input.  //Note: This option value is also set/used by [[SearchOptionsPlugin]]//.
*To set the maximum height of the listbox, you can create a tiddler tagged with &lt;&lt;tag systemConfig&gt;&gt;, containing:
//{{{
config.macros.gotoTiddler.listMaxSize=10;  // change this number
//}}}

|Description|show content in nest-able sliding/floating panels, without creating separate tiddlers for each panel's content|
!!!!!Documentation
&gt;see [[NestedSlidersPluginInfo]]
!!!!!Configuration
&lt;&lt;&lt;
&lt;&lt;option chkFloatingSlidersAnimate&gt;&gt; allow floating sliders to animate when opening/closing
&gt;Note: This setting can cause 'clipping' problems in some versions of InternetExplorer.
&gt;In addition, for floating slider animation to occur you must also allow animation in general (see [[AdvancedOptions]]).
&lt;&lt;&lt;
!!!!!Revisions
&lt;&lt;&lt;
2008.11.15 - 2.4.9 in adjustNestedSlider(), don't make adjustments if panel is marked as 'undocked' (CSS class).  In onClickNestedSlider(), SHIFT-CLICK docks panel (see [[MoveablePanelPlugin]])
|please see [[NestedSlidersPluginInfo]] for additional revision details|
2005.11.03 - 1.0.0 initial public release.  Thanks to RodneyGomes, GeoffSlocock, and PaulPetterson for suggestions and experiments.

Usage:
&lt;&lt;&lt;
in tiddler content:
{{{
&lt;&lt;tiddler QuickNote with: format &quot;tag [[tag with spaces]] tag tag&quot;...&gt;&gt;
}}}
in PageTemplate (added to story column):
{{{

&lt;/div&gt;
}}}
where ''format'' specifies a TiddlyWiki date format string (e.g. &quot;&quot;&quot;YYYY0MM0DD0hh0mm0ss&quot;&quot;&quot;) that is used to generate a unique tiddler title for each new note that is created, by combining the TW username with a //timestamp// for the current time and ''tag tag tag'' are //optional// tag values to add to the newly created notes.
&lt;&lt;&lt;
Example:
&lt;&lt;&lt;
{{{&lt;&lt;tiddler QuickNote with: -YYYY0MM0DD0hh0mm0ss &quot;quicknote journal&quot;&gt;&gt;}}}

|Description|display droplist of recently changed tiddlers with goto, edit, and preview buttons|
!!!!!Usage
&lt;&lt;&lt;
The {{{&lt;&lt;recentChanges&gt;&gt;}}} macro displays a droplist of all tiddlers that have been changed within the last N days (default=10 days).  
{{{
&lt;&lt;recentChanges&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;recentChanges #ofdays summary noEdit previewheight previewclass&gt;&gt;
}}}
where:
* #ofdays specifies the time limit for listing changed tiddlers.  Use 0 (zero) to list all tiddlers in the document.
* ''summary'' is an optional keyword that outputs only the summary text (without the droplist or buttons)
* ''noEdit'' is an optional keyword that hides the 'edit' button
* previewheight is a CSS height measurement and sets the FIXED height of the tiddler preview area (default is 15em)
* previewclass is any CSS classname, and can be used to apply custom styles to the preview area (default is to use the standard 'viewer' class)
&lt;&lt;&lt;
!!!!!Examples
&lt;&lt;&lt;
{{smallform{
{{{&lt;&lt;recentChanges&gt;&gt;}}}

|Name|SearchOptionsPlugin|

|Version|3.0.7|
|Author|Eric Shulman|
|License|http://www.TiddlyTools.com/#LegalStatements|
|~CoreVersion|2.1|
|Type|plugin|
|Description|extend core search function with additional user-configurable options|
Adds extra options to core search function including selecting which data items to search, enabling/disabling incremental key-by-key searches, and generating a ''list of matching tiddlers'' instead of immediately displaying all matches.  This plugin also adds syntax for rendering 'search links' within tiddler content to embed one-click searches using pre-defined 'hard-coded' search terms.
!!!!!Documentation
&gt;see [[SearchOptionsPluginInfo]]
!!!!!Configuration
&lt;&lt;&lt;
Search in:
&lt;&lt;option chkSearchTitles&gt;&gt; titles &lt;&lt;option chkSearchText&gt;&gt; text &lt;&lt;option chkSearchTags&gt;&gt; tags &lt;&lt;option chkSearchFields&gt;&gt; fields &lt;&lt;option chkSearchShadows&gt;&gt; shadows
&lt;&lt;option chkSearchHighlight&gt;&gt; Highlight matching text in displayed tiddlers
&lt;&lt;option chkSearchList&gt;&gt; Show list of matches
&lt;&lt;option chkSearchListTiddler&gt;&gt; Write list to [[SearchResults]] tiddler
&lt;&lt;option chkSearchTitlesFirst&gt;&gt; Show title matches first
&lt;&lt;option chkSearchByDate&gt;&gt; Sort matching tiddlers by modification date (most recent first)
&lt;&lt;option chkIncrementalSearch&gt;&gt; Incremental key-by-key search: {{twochar{&lt;&lt;option txtIncrementalSearchMin&gt;&gt;}}} or more characters,  {{threechar{&lt;&lt;option txtIncrementalSearchDelay&gt;&gt;}}} msec delay
&lt;&lt;option chkSearchOpenTiddlers&gt;&gt; Search only in tiddlers that are currently displayed
&lt;&lt;option chkSearchExcludeTags&gt;&gt; Exclude tiddlers tagged with: &lt;&lt;option txtSearchExcludeTags&gt;&gt;

<pre>From fairest creatures we desire increase,
That thereby beauty's rose might never die,
But as the riper should by time decease,
His tender heir might bear his memory:
But thou, contracted to thine own bright eyes,
Feed'st thy light'st flame with self-substantial fuel,
Making a famine where abundance lies,
Thyself thy foe, to thy sweet self too cruel.
Thou that art now the world's fresh ornament
And only herald to the gaudy spring,
Within thine own bud buriest thy content
And, tender churl, makest waste in niggarding.
  Pity the world, or else this glutton be,
  To eat the world's due, by the grave and thee.</pre>
</div>

<pre>When forty winters shall beseige thy brow,
And dig deep trenches in thy beauty's field,
Thy youth's proud livery, so gazed on now,
Will be a tatter'd weed, of small worth held:
Then being ask'd where all thy beauty lies,
Where all the treasure of thy lusty days,
To say, within thine own deep-sunken eyes,
Were an all-eating shame and thriftless praise.
How much more praise deserved thy beauty's use,
If thou couldst answer 'This fair child of mine
Shall sum my count and make my old excuse,'
Proving his beauty by succession thine!
  This were to be new made when thou art old,
  And see thy blood warm when thou feel'st it cold.</pre>
</div>
<div title="Sonnet 003" modifier="ELSDesignStudios" created="201003100636" tags="sonnet" changecount="1">
<pre>Look in thy glass, and tell the face thou viewest
Now is the time that face should form another;
Whose fresh repair if now thou not renewest,
Thou dost beguile the world, unbless some mother.
For where is she so fair whose unear'd womb
Disdains the tillage of thy husbandry?
Or who is he so fond will be the tomb
Of his self-love, to stop posterity?
Thou art thy mother's glass, and she in thee
Calls back the lovely April of her prime:
So thou through windows of thine age shall see
Despite of wrinkles this thy golden time.
  But if thou live, remember'd not to be,
  Die single, and thine image dies with thee.</pre>
</div>
<div title="Sonnet 004" modifier="ELSDesignStudios" created="201003100636" tags="sonnet" changecount="1">
<pre>Unthrifty loveliness, why dost thou spend
Upon thyself thy beauty's legacy?
Nature's bequest gives nothing but doth lend,
And being frank she lends to those are free.
Then, beauteous niggard, why dost thou abuse
The bounteous largess given thee to give?
Profitless usurer, why dost thou use
So great a sum of sums, yet canst not live?
For having traffic with thyself alone,
Thou of thyself thy sweet self dost deceive.
Then how, when nature calls thee to be gone,
What acceptable audit canst thou leave?
  Thy unused beauty must be tomb'd with thee,
  Which, used, lives th' executor to be.</pre>

<pre>Those hours, that with gentle work did frame
The lovely gaze where every eye doth dwell,
Will play the tyrants to the very same
And that unfair which fairly doth excel:
For never-resting time leads summer on
To hideous winter and confounds him there;
Sap cheque'd with frost and lusty leaves quite gone,
Beauty o'ersnow'd and bareness every where:
Then, were not summer's distillation left,
A liquid prisoner pent in walls of glass,
Beauty's effect with beauty were bereft,
Nor it nor no remembrance what it was:
  But flowers distill'd though they with winter meet,
  Leese but their show; their substance still lives sweet.</pre>
</div>
<div title="Sonnet 006" modifier="ELSDesignStudios" created="201003100636" tags="sonnet" changecount="1">
<pre>Then let not winter's ragged hand deface
In thee thy summer, ere thou be distill'd:
Make sweet some vial; treasure thou some place
With beauty's treasure, ere it be self-kill'd.
That use is not forbidden usury,
Which happies those that pay the willing loan;
That's for thyself to breed another thee,
Or ten times happier, be it ten for one;
Ten times thyself were happier than thou art,
If ten of thine ten times refigured thee:
Then what could death do, if thou shouldst depart,
Leaving thee living in posterity?
  Be not self-will'd, for thou art much too fair
  To be death's conquest and make worms thine heir.</pre>

<pre>Lo! in the orient when the gracious light
Lifts up his burning head, each under eye
Doth homage to his new-appearing sight,
Serving with looks his sacred majesty;
And having climb'd the steep-up heavenly hill,
Resembling strong youth in his middle age,
yet mortal looks adore his beauty still,
Attending on his golden pilgrimage;
But when from highmost pitch, with weary car,
Like feeble age, he reeleth from the day,
The eyes, 'fore duteous, now converted are
From his low tract and look another way:
  So thou, thyself out-going in thy noon,
  Unlook'd on diest, unless thou get a son.</pre>

<div title="Sonnet 008" modifier="ELSDesignStudios" created="201003100636" tags="sonnet" changecount="1">
<pre>Music to hear, why hear'st thou music sadly?
Sweets with sweets war not, joy delights in joy.
Why lovest thou that which thou receivest not gladly,
Or else receivest with pleasure thine annoy?
If the true concord of well-tuned sounds,
By unions married, do offend thine ear,
They do but sweetly chide thee, who confounds
In singleness the parts that thou shouldst bear.
Mark how one string, sweet husband to another,
Strikes each in each by mutual ordering,
Resembling sire and child and happy mother
Who all in one, one pleasing note do sing:
  Whose speechless song, being many, seeming one,
  Sings this to thee: 'thou single wilt prove none.'</pre>

<pre>Is it for fear to wet a widow's eye
That thou consumest thyself in single life?
Ah! if thou issueless shalt hap to die.
The world will wail thee, like a makeless wife;
The world will be thy widow and still weep
That thou no form of thee hast left behind,
When every private widow well may keep
By children's eyes her husband's shape in mind.
Look, what an unthrift in the world doth spend
Shifts but his place, for still the world enjoys it;
But beauty's waste hath in the world an end,
And kept unused, the user so destroys it.
  No love toward others in that bosom sits
  That on himself such murderous shame commits.</pre>
</div>
<div title="Sonnet 010" modifier="ELSDesignStudios" created="201003100636" tags="sonnet" changecount="1">
<pre>For shame! deny that thou bear'st love to any,
Who for thyself art so unprovident.
Grant, if thou wilt, thou art beloved of many,
But that thou none lovest is most evident;
For thou art so possess'd with murderous hate
That 'gainst thyself thou stick'st not to conspire.
Seeking that beauteous roof to ruinate
Which to repair should be thy chief desire.
O, change thy thought, that I may change my mind!
Shall hate be fairer lodged than gentle love?
Be, as thy presence is, gracious and kind,
Or to thyself at least kind-hearted prove:
  Make thee another self, for love of me,
  That beauty still may live in thine or thee.</pre>

<pre>As fast as thou shalt wane, so fast thou growest
In one of thine, from that which thou departest;
And that fresh blood which youngly thou bestowest
Thou mayst call thine when thou from youth convertest.
Herein lives wisdom, beauty and increase:
Without this, folly, age and cold decay:
If all were minded so, the times should cease
And threescore year would make the world away.
Let those whom Nature hath not made for store,
Harsh featureless and rude, barrenly perish:
Look, whom she best endow'd she gave the more;
Which bounteous gift thou shouldst in bounty cherish:
  She carved thee for her seal, and meant thereby
  Thou shouldst print more, not let that copy die.</pre>

<pre>When I do count the clock that tells the time,
And see the brave day sunk in hideous night;
When I behold the violet past prime,
And sable curls all silver'd o'er with white;
When lofty trees I see barren of leaves
Which erst from heat did canopy the herd,
And summer's green all girded up in sheaves
Borne on the bier with white and bristly beard,
Then of thy beauty do I question make,
That thou among the wastes of time must go,
Since sweets and beauties do themselves forsake
And die as fast as they see others grow;
  And nothing 'gainst Time's scythe can make defence
  Save breed, to brave him when he takes thee hence.
O, that you were yourself! but, love, you are
No longer yours than you yourself here live:
Against this coming end you should prepare,
And your sweet semblance to some other give.
So should that beauty which you hold in lease
Find no determination: then you were
Yourself again after yourself's decease,
When your sweet issue your sweet form should bear.
Who lets so fair a house fall to decay,
Which husbandry in honour might uphold
Against the stormy gusts of winter's day
And barren rage of death's eternal cold?
  O, none but unthrifts! Dear my love, you know
  You had a father: let your son say so.</pre>

<pre>So, now I have confess'd that he is thine,
And I myself am mortgaged to thy will,
Myself I'll forfeit, so that other mine
Thou wilt restore, to be my comfort still:
But thou wilt not, nor he will not be free,
For thou art covetous and he is kind;
He learn'd but surety-like to write for me
Under that bond that him as fast doth bind.
The statute of thy beauty thou wilt take,
Thou usurer, that put'st forth all to use,
And sue a friend came debtor for my sake;
So him I lose through my unkind abuse.
  Him have I lost; thou hast both him and me:
  He pays the whole, and yet am I not free.</pre>

<pre>Not from the stars do I my judgment pluck;
And yet methinks I have astronomy,
But not to tell of good or evil luck,
Of plagues, of dearths, or seasons' quality;
Nor can I fortune to brief minutes tell,
Pointing to each his thunder, rain and wind,
Or say with princes if it shall go well,
By oft predict that I in heaven find:
But from thine eyes my knowledge I derive,
And, constant stars, in them I read such art
As truth and beauty shall together thrive,
If from thyself to store thou wouldst convert;
  Or else of thee this I prognosticate:
  Thy end is truth's and beauty's doom and date.</pre>

<pre>When I consider every thing that grows
Holds in perfection but a little moment,
That this huge stage presenteth nought but shows
Whereon the stars in secret influence comment;
When I perceive that men as plants increase,
Cheered and cheque'd even by the self-same sky,
Vaunt in their youthful sap, at height decrease,
And wear their brave state out of memory;
Then the conceit of this inconstant stay
Sets you most rich in youth before my sight,
Where wasteful Time debateth with Decay,
To change your day of youth to sullied night;
  And all in war with Time for love of you,
  As he takes from you, I engraft you new.</pre>

<pre>But wherefore do not you a mightier way
Make war upon this bloody tyrant, Time?
And fortify yourself in your decay
With means more blessed than my barren rhyme?
Now stand you on the top of happy hours,
And many maiden gardens yet unset
With virtuous wish would bear your living flowers,
Much liker than your painted counterfeit:
So should the lines of life that life repair,
Which this, Time's pencil, or my pupil pen,
Neither in inward worth nor outward fair,
Can make you live yourself in eyes of men.
  To give away yourself keeps yourself still,
  And you must live, drawn by your own sweet skill.</pre>

<pre>Who will believe my verse in time to come,
If it were fill'd with your most high deserts?
Though yet, heaven knows, it is but as a tomb
Which hides your life and shows not half your parts.
If I could write the beauty of your eyes
And in fresh numbers number all your graces,
The age to come would say 'This poet lies:
Such heavenly touches ne'er touch'd earthly faces.'
So should my papers yellow'd with their age
Be scorn'd like old men of less truth than tongue,
And your true rights be term'd a poet's rage
And stretched metre of an antique song:
  But were some child of yours alive that time,
  You should live twice; in it and in my rhyme.</pre>

<pre>Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?
Thou art more lovely and more temperate:
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
And summer's lease hath all too short a date:
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
And often is his gold complexion dimm'd;
And every fair from fair sometime declines,
By chance or nature's changing course untrimm'd;
But thy eternal summer shall not fade
Nor lose possession of that fair thou owest;
Nor shall Death brag thou wander'st in his shade,
When in eternal lines to time thou growest:
  So long as men can breathe or eyes can see,
  So long lives this and this gives life to thee.</pre>

<pre>Devouring Time, blunt thou the lion's paws,
And make the earth devour her own sweet brood;
Pluck the keen teeth from the fierce tiger's jaws,
And burn the long-lived phoenix in her blood;
Make glad and sorry seasons as thou fleets,
And do whate'er thou wilt, swift-footed Time,
To the wide world and all her fading sweets;
But I forbid thee one most heinous crime:
O, carve not with thy hours my love's fair brow,
Nor draw no lines there with thine antique pen;
Him in thy course untainted do allow
For beauty's pattern to succeeding men.
  Yet, do thy worst, old Time: despite thy wrong,
  My love shall in my verse ever live young.</pre>

<pre>A woman's face with Nature's own hand painted
Hast thou, the master-mistress of my passion;
A woman's gentle heart, but not acquainted
With shifting change, as is false women's fashion;
An eye more bright than theirs, less false in rolling,
Gilding the object whereupon it gazeth;
A man in hue, all 'hues' in his controlling,
Much steals men's eyes and women's souls amazeth.
And for a woman wert thou first created;
Till Nature, as she wrought thee, fell a-doting,

Stirr'd by a painted beauty to his verse,

And every fair with his fair doth rehearse
Making a couplement of proud compare,
With sun and moon, with earth and sea's rich gems,
With April's first-born flowers, and all things rare
That heaven's air in this huge rondure hems.
O' let me, true in love, but truly write,
And then believe me, my love is as fair

Is but the seemly raiment of my heart,
Which in thy breast doth live, as thine in me:
How can I then be elder than thou art?
O, therefore, love, be of thyself so wary
As I, not for myself, but for thee will;
Bearing thy heart, which I will keep so chary
As tender nurse her babe from faring ill.
  Presume not on thy heart when mine is slain;

And in mine own love's strength seem to decay,
O'ercharged with burden of mine own love's might.

To find where your true image pictured lies;

That hath his windows glazed with thine eyes.
Now see what good turns eyes for eyes have done:
Mine eyes have drawn thy shape, and thine for me

And from the forlorn world his visage hide,
Stealing unseen to west with this disgrace:

<pre>Being your slave, what should I do but tend
Upon the hours and times of your desire?
I have no precious time at all to spend,
Nor services to do, till you require.
Nor dare I chide the world-without-end hour
Whilst I, my sovereign, watch the clock for you,
Nor think the bitterness of absence sour
When you have bid your servant once adieu;
Nor dare I question with my jealous thought
Where you may be, or your affairs suppose,
But, like a sad slave, stay and think of nought
Save, where you are how happy you make those.
  So true a fool is love that in your will,
  Though you do any thing, he thinks no ill.</pre>

Being your vassal, bound to stay your leisure!
O, let me suffer, being at your beck,
The imprison'd absence of your liberty;
And patience, tame to sufferance, bide each cheque,
Without accusing you of injury.
Be where you list, your charter is so strong
That you yourself may privilege your time
To what you will; to you it doth belong
Yourself to pardon of self-doing crime.
  I am to wait, though waiting so be hell;
  Not blame your pleasure, be it ill or well.</pre>

Which, labouring for invention, bear amiss
The second burden of a former child!

Even of five hundred courses of the sun,
Show me your image in some antique book,
Since mind at first in character was done!
That I might see what the old world could say
To this composed wonder of your frame;
Whether we are mended, or whether better they,
Or whether revolution be the same.
  O, sure I am, the wits of former days
  To subjects worse have given admiring praise.</pre>

Nativity, once in the main of light,
Crawls to maturity, wherewith being crown'd,
Crooked elipses 'gainst his glory fight,
And Time that gave doth now his gift confound.
Time doth transfix the flourish set on youth
And delves the parallels in beauty's brow,
Feeds on the rarities of nature's truth,
And nothing stands but for his scythe to mow:
  And yet to times in hope my verse shall stand,

To find out shames and idle hours in me,
The scope and tenor of thy jealousy?
O, no! thy love, though much, is not so great:
It is my love that keeps mine eye awake;
Mine own true love that doth my rest defeat,
To play the watchman ever for thy sake:

And for myself mine own worth do define,
As I all other in all worths surmount.

Stealing away the treasure of his spring;
For such a time do I now fortify

Increasing store with loss and loss with store;

Against the wreckful siege of battering days,
When rocks impregnable are not so stout,
Nor gates of steel so strong, but Time decays?
O fearful meditation! where, alack,
Shall Time's best jewel from Time's chest lie hid?
Or what strong hand can hold his swift foot back?

And right perfection wrongfully disgraced,
And strength by limping sway disabled,

Why should poor beauty indirectly seek
Roses of shadow, since his rose is true?
Why should he live, now Nature bankrupt is,
Beggar'd of blood to blush through lively veins?

To live a second life on second head;
Ere beauty's dead fleece made another gay:
In him those holy antique hours are seen,
Without all ornament, itself and true,
Making no summer of another's green,
Robbing no old to dress his beauty new;

But those same tongues that give thee so thine own
In other accents do this praise confound
By seeing farther than the eye hath shown.
They look into the beauty of thy mind,
And that, in guess, they measure by thy deeds;
Then, churls, their thoughts, although their eyes were kind,

For canker vice the sweetest buds doth love,

As after sunset fadeth in the west,
Which by and by black night doth take away,
Death's second self, that seals up all in rest.
In me thou see'st the glowing of such fire
That on the ashes of his youth doth lie,
As the death-bed whereon it must expire
Consumed with that which it was nourish'd by.

The earth can have but earth, which is his due;
My spirit is thine, the better part of me:

Doubting the filching age will steal his treasure,
Now counting best to be with you alone,
Then better'd that the world may see my pleasure;
Sometime all full with feasting on your sight
And by and by clean starved for a look;
Possessing or pursuing no delight,

That every word doth almost tell my name,
Showing their birth and where they did proceed?
O, know, sweet love, I always write of you,

Spending again what is already spent:

Have added feathers to the learned's wing
And given grace a double majesty.
Yet be most proud of that which I compile,

Yet what of thee thy poet doth invent
He robs thee of and pays it thee again.
He lends thee virtue and he stole that word

The humble as the proudest sail doth bear,
My saucy bark inferior far to his
On your broad main doth wilfully appear.
Your shallowest help will hold me up afloat,

And therefore art enforced to seek anew
Some fresher stamp of the time-bettering days
And do so, love; yet when they have devised

But he that writes of you, if he can tell
That you are you, so dignifies his story,
Let him but copy what in you is writ,

To every hymn that able spirit affords
In polish'd form of well-refined pen.
Hearing you praised, I say ''Tis so, 'tis true,'
And to the most of praise add something more;

Above a mortal pitch, that struck me dead?
No, neither he, nor his compeers by night
Giving him aid, my verse astonished.

The cause of this fair gift in me is wanting,
And so my patent back again is swerving.
Thyself thou gavest, thy own worth then not knowing,
Or me, to whom thou gavest it, else mistaking;

For there can live no hatred in thine eye,
Therefore in that I cannot know thy change.
In many's looks the false heart's history
Is writ in moods and frowns and wrinkles strange,
But heaven in thy creation did decree
That in thy face sweet love should ever dwell;
Whate'er thy thoughts or thy heart's workings be,
Thy looks should nothing thence but sweetness tell.
  How like Eve's apple doth thy beauty grow,
  if thy sweet virtue answer not thy show!</pre>

They are the lords and owners of their faces,
Others but stewards of their excellence.

Making lascivious comments on thy sport,

The teeming autumn, big with rich increase,
Bearing the wanton burden of the prime,
Like widow'd wombs after their lords' decease:
Yet this abundant issue seem'd to me
But hope of orphans and unfather'd fruit;

Of different flowers in odour and in hue
Could make me any summer's story tell,
Or from their proud lap pluck them where they grew;
Nor did I wonder at the lily's white,

In my love's veins thou hast too grossly dyed.
The lily I condemned for thy hand,
And buds of marjoram had stol'n thy hair:
The roses fearfully on thorns did stand,
One blushing shame, another white despair;
A third, nor red nor white, had stol'n of both
And to his robbery had annex'd thy breath;
But, for his theft, in pride of all his growth
A vengeful canker eat him up to death.

In gentle numbers time so idly spent;
Sing to the ear that doth thy lays esteem

Beauty no pencil, beauty's truth to lay;

When I was wont to greet it with my lays,
As Philomel in summer's front doth sing
And stops her pipe in growth of riper days:
Not that the summer is less pleasant now

That over-goes my blunt invention quite,
Dulling my lines and doing me disgrace.
Were it not sinful then, striving to mend,

Three beauteous springs to yellow autumn turn'd
In process of the seasons have I seen,
Three April perfumes in three hot Junes burn'd,
Since first I saw you fresh, which yet are green.
Ah! yet doth beauty, like a dial-hand,
Steal from his figure and no pace perceived;
So your sweet hue, which methinks still doth stand,
Hath motion and mine eye may be deceived:

Still constant in a wondrous excellence;
Therefore my verse to constancy confined,
One thing expressing, leaves out difference.
'Fair, kind and true' is all my argument,
'Fair, kind, and true' varying to other words;

Of hand, of foot, of lip, of eye, of brow,
I see their antique pen would have express'd
Even such a beauty as you master now.
So all their praises are but prophecies
Of this our time, all you prefiguring;
And, for they look'd but with divining eyes,
They had not skill enough your worth to sing:

Incertainties now crown themselves assured
And peace proclaims olives of endless age.
Now with the drops of this most balmy time
My love looks fresh, and death to me subscribes,
Since, spite of him, I'll live in this poor rhyme,
While he insults o'er dull and speechless tribes:
  And thou in this shalt find thy monument,

I must, each day say o'er the very same,
Counting no old thing old, thou mine, I thine,
Even as when first I hallow'd thy fair name.
So that eternal love in love's fresh case
Weighs not the dust and injury of age,
Nor gives to necessary wrinkles place,
But makes antiquity for aye his page,

Like him that travels I return again,
Just to the time, not with the time exchanged,
So that myself bring water for my stain.
Never believe, though in my nature reign'd
All frailties that besiege all kinds of blood,

Askance and strangely: but, by all above,
These blenches gave my heart another youth,
And worse essays proved thee my best of love.
Now all is done, have what shall have no end:

Of his quick objects hath the mind no part,
Nor his own vision holds what it doth catch:

Such cherubins as your sweet self resemble,
Creating every bad a perfect best,
As fast as objects to his beams assemble?
O,'tis the first; 'tis flattery in my seeing,
And my great mind most kingly drinks it up:

Tan sacred beauty, blunt the sharp'st intents,
Divert strong minds to the course of altering things;

It is the star to every wandering bark,
Whose worth's unknown, although his height be taken.
Love's not Time's fool, though rosy lips and cheeks

That I have hoisted sail to all the winds
Which should transport me farthest from your sight.
Book both my wilfulness and errors down

To bitter sauces did I frame my feeding
And, sick of welfare, found a kind of meetness
To be diseased ere that there was true needing.
Thus policy in love, to anticipate

Past reason hated, as a swallow'd bait
On purpose laid to make the taker mad;
Mad in pursuit and in possession so;
Had, having, and in quest to have, extreme;
A bliss in proof, and proved, a very woe;
Before, a joy proposed; behind, a dream.
  All this the world well knows; yet none knows well
  To shun the heaven that leads men to this hell.</pre>

<pre>My mistress' eyes are nothing like the sun;
Coral is far more red than her lips' red;
If snow be white, why then her breasts are dun;
If hairs be wires, black wires grow on her head.
I have seen roses damask'd, red and white,
But no such roses see I in her cheeks;
And in some perfumes is there more delight
Than in the breath that from my mistress reeks.
I love to hear her speak, yet well I know
That music hath a far more pleasing sound;
I grant I never saw a goddess go;
My mistress, when she walks, treads on the ground:
  And yet, by heaven, I think my love as rare
  As any she belied with false compare.</pre>

<pre>Thou art as tyrannous, so as thou art,
As those whose beauties proudly make them cruel;
For well thou know'st to my dear doting heart
Thou art the fairest and most precious jewel.
Yet, in good faith, some say that thee behold
Thy face hath not the power to make love groan:
To say they err I dare not be so bold,
Although I swear it to myself alone.
And, to be sure that is not false I swear,
A thousand groans, but thinking on thy face,
One on another's neck, do witness bear
Thy black is fairest in my judgment's place.
  In nothing art thou black save in thy deeds,
  And thence this slander, as I think, proceeds.</pre>

<pre>Thine eyes I love, and they, as pitying me,
Knowing thy heart torments me with disdain,
Have put on black and loving mourners be,
Looking with pretty ruth upon my pain.
And truly not the morning sun of heaven
Better becomes the grey cheeks of the east,
Nor that full star that ushers in the even
Doth half that glory to the sober west,
As those two mourning eyes become thy face:
O, let it then as well beseem thy heart
To mourn for me, since mourning doth thee grace,
And suit thy pity like in every part.
  Then will I swear beauty herself is black
  And all they foul that thy complexion lack.</pre>

<pre>Beshrew that heart that makes my heart to groan
For that deep wound it gives my friend and me!
Is't not enough to torture me alone,
But slave to slavery my sweet'st friend must be?
Me from myself thy cruel eye hath taken,
And my next self thou harder hast engross'd:
Of him, myself, and thee, I am forsaken;
A torment thrice threefold thus to be cross'd.
Prison my heart in thy steel bosom's ward,
But then my friend's heart let my poor heart bail;
Whoe'er keeps me, let my heart be his guard;
Thou canst not then use rigor in my gaol:
  And yet thou wilt; for I, being pent in thee,
  Perforce am thine, and all that is in me.</pre>

And 'Will' to boot, and 'Will' in overplus;
More than enough am I that vex thee still,
To thy sweet will making addition thus.
Wilt thou, whose will is large and spacious,
Not once vouchsafe to hide my will in thine?
Shall will in others seem right gracious,
And in my will no fair acceptance shine?
The sea all water, yet receives rain still
And in abundance addeth to his store;
So thou, being rich in 'Will,' add to thy 'Will'
One will of mine, to make thy large 'Will' more.
  Let no unkind, no fair beseechers kill;
  Think all but one, and me in that one 'Will.'</pre>

And will, thy soul knows, is admitted there;
Thus far for love my love-suit, sweet, fulfil.
'Will' will fulfil the treasure of thy love,
Ay, fill it full with wills, and my will one.
In things of great receipt with ease we prove
Among a number one is reckon'd none:
Then in the number let me pass untold,
Though in thy stores' account I one must be;
For nothing hold me, so it please thee hold
That nothing me, a something sweet to thee:
  Make but my name thy love, and love that still,

<pre>Thou blind fool, Love, what dost thou to mine eyes,
That they behold, and see not what they see?
They know what beauty is, see where it lies,
Yet what the best is take the worst to be.
If eyes corrupt by over-partial looks
Be anchor'd in the bay where all men ride,
Why of eyes' falsehood hast thou forged hooks,
Whereto the judgment of my heart is tied?
Why should my heart think that a several plot
Which my heart knows the wide world's common place?
Or mine eyes seeing this, say this is not,
To put fair truth upon so foul a face?
  In things right true my heart and eyes have erred,
  And to this false plague are they now transferr'd.</pre>

<pre>When my love swears that she is made of truth
I do believe her, though I know she lies,
That she might think me some untutor'd youth,
Unlearned in the world's false subtleties.
Thus vainly thinking that she thinks me young,
Although she knows my days are past the best,
Simply I credit her false speaking tongue:
On both sides thus is simple truth suppress'd.
But wherefore says she not she is unjust?
And wherefore say not I that I am old?
O, love's best habit is in seeming trust,
And age in love loves not to have years told:
  Therefore I lie with her and she with me,
  And in our faults by lies we flatter'd be.</pre>

That thy unkindness lays upon my heart;
Wound me not with thine eye but with thy tongue;
Use power with power and slay me not by art.
Tell me thou lovest elsewhere, but in my sight,
Dear heart, forbear to glance thine eye aside:
What need'st thou wound with cunning when thy might
Is more than my o'er-press'd defense can bide?
Let me excuse thee: ah! my love well knows
Her pretty looks have been mine enemies,
And therefore from my face she turns my foes,
That they elsewhere might dart their injuries:
  Yet do not so; but since I am near slain,
  Kill me outright with looks and rid my pain.</pre>

<pre>Be wise as thou art cruel; do not press
My tongue-tied patience with too much disdain;
Lest sorrow lend me words and words express
The manner of my pity-wanting pain.
If I might teach thee wit, better it were,
Though not to love, yet, love, to tell me so;
As testy sick men, when their deaths be near,
No news but health from their physicians know;
For if I should despair, I should grow mad,
And in my madness might speak ill of thee:
Now this ill-wresting world is grown so bad,
Mad slanderers by mad ears believed be,
  That I may not be so, nor thou belied,
  Bear thine eyes straight, though thy proud heart go wide.</pre>

For they in thee a thousand errors note;
But 'tis my heart that loves what they despise,
Who in despite of view is pleased to dote;
Nor are mine ears with thy tongue's tune delighted,
Nor tender feeling, to base touches prone,
Nor taste, nor smell, desire to be invited
To any sensual feast with thee alone:
But my five wits nor my five senses can
Dissuade one foolish heart from serving thee,
Who leaves unsway'd the likeness of a man,
Thy proud hearts slave and vassal wretch to be:
  Only my plague thus far I count my gain,

Hate of my sin, grounded on sinful loving:
O, but with mine compare thou thine own state,
And thou shalt find it merits not reproving;
Or, if it do, not from those lips of thine,
That have profaned their scarlet ornaments
And seal'd false bonds of love as oft as mine,
Robb'd others' beds' revenues of their rents.
Be it lawful I love thee, as thou lovest those
Whom thine eyes woo as mine importune thee:
Root pity in thy heart, that when it grows
Thy pity may deserve to pitied be.
  If thou dost seek to have what thou dost hide,
  By self-example mayst thou be denied!</pre>

<pre>Lo! as a careful housewife runs to catch
One of her feather'd creatures broke away,
Sets down her babe and makes an swift dispatch
In pursuit of the thing she would have stay,
Whilst her neglected child holds her in chase,
Cries to catch her whose busy care is bent
To follow that which flies before her face,
Not prizing her poor infant's discontent;
So runn'st thou after that which flies from thee,
Whilst I thy babe chase thee afar behind;
But if thou catch thy hope, turn back to me,
And play the mother's part, kiss me, be kind:
  So will I pray that thou mayst have thy 'Will,'
  If thou turn back, and my loud crying still.</pre>

<pre>Two loves I have of comfort and despair,
Which like two spirits do suggest me still:
The better angel is a man right fair,
The worser spirit a woman colour'd ill.
To win me soon to hell, my female evil
Tempteth my better angel from my side,
And would corrupt my saint to be a devil,
Wooing his purity with her foul pride.
And whether that my angel be turn'd fiend
Suspect I may, but not directly tell;
But being both from me, both to each friend,
I guess one angel in another's hell:
  Yet this shall I ne'er know, but live in doubt,

Breathed forth the sound that said 'I hate'
To me that languish'd for her sake;
But when she saw my woeful state,
Straight in her heart did mercy come,
Chiding that tongue that ever sweet
Was used in giving gentle doom,
And taught it thus anew to greet:
'I hate' she alter'd with an end,
That follow'd it as gentle day
Doth follow night, who like a fiend
From heaven to hell is flown away;
  'I hate' from hate away she threw,
  And saved my life, saying 'not you.'</pre>

<pre>Poor soul, the centre of my sinful earth,
[         ] these rebel powers that thee array;
Why dost thou pine within and suffer dearth,
Painting thy outward walls so costly gay?
Why so large cost, having so short a lease,
Dost thou upon thy fading mansion spend?
Shall worms, inheritors of this excess,
Eat up thy charge? is this thy body's end?
Then soul, live thou upon thy servant's loss,
And let that pine to aggravate thy store;
Buy terms divine in selling hours of dross;
Within be fed, without be rich no more:
  So shalt thou feed on Death, that feeds on men,
  And Death once dead, there's no more dying then.</pre>

<pre>My love is as a fever, longing still
For that which longer nurseth the disease,
Feeding on that which doth preserve the ill,
The uncertain sickly appetite to please.
My reason, the physician to my love,
Angry that his prescriptions are not kept,
Hath left me, and I desperate now approve
Desire is death, which physic did except.
Past cure I am, now reason is past care,
And frantic-mad with evermore unrest;
My thoughts and my discourse as madmen's are,
At random from the truth vainly express'd;
  For I have sworn thee fair and thought thee bright,

Which have no correspondence with true sight!
Or, if they have, where is my judgment fled,
That censures falsely what they see aright?
If that be fair whereon my false eyes dote,
What means the world to say it is not so?
If it be not, then love doth well denote
Love's eye is not so true as all men's 'No.'
How can it? O, how can Love's eye be true,
That is so vex'd with watching and with tears?
No marvel then, though I mistake my view;
The sun itself sees not till heaven clears.
  O cunning Love! with tears thou keep'st me blind,

On whom frown'st thou that I do fawn upon?
Nay, if thou lour'st on me, do I not spend
Revenge upon myself with present moan?
What merit do I in myself respect,
That is so proud thy service to despise,
When all my best doth worship thy defect,
Commanded by the motion of thine eyes?
  But, love, hate on, for now I know thy mind;

With insufficiency my heart to sway?
To make me give the lie to my true sight,
And swear that brightness doth not grace the day?
Whence hast thou this becoming of things ill,
That in the very refuse of thy deeds
There is such strength and warrantize of skill
That, in my mind, thy worst all best exceeds?
Who taught thee how to make me love thee more
The more I hear and see just cause of hate?
O, though I love what others do abhor,
With others thou shouldst not abhor my state:
  If thy unworthiness raised love in me,
  More worthy I to be beloved of thee.</pre>

Yet who knows not conscience is born of love?
Then, gentle cheater, urge not my amiss,
Lest guilty of my faults thy sweet self prove:
For, thou betraying me, I do betray
My nobler part to my gross body's treason;
My soul doth tell my body that he may
Triumph in love; flesh stays no father reason;
But, rising at thy name, doth point out thee
As his triumphant prize. Proud of this pride,
He is contented thy poor drudge to be,
To stand in thy affairs, fall by thy side.
  No want of conscience hold it that I call

In act thy bed-vow broke and new faith torn,
In vowing new hate after new love bearing.
But why of two oaths' breach do I accuse thee,
When I break twenty? I am perjured most;
For all my vows are oaths but to misuse thee
And all my honest faith in thee is lost,
For I have sworn deep oaths of thy deep kindness,
Oaths of thy love, thy truth, thy constancy,
And, to enlighten thee, gave eyes to blindness,
Or made them swear against the thing they see;
  For I have sworn thee fair; more perjured I,
  To swear against the truth so foul a lie!</pre>

<pre>Cupid laid by his brand, and fell asleep:
A maid of Dian's this advantage found,
And his love-kindling fire did quickly steep
In a cold valley-fountain of that ground;
Which borrow'd from this holy fire of Love
A dateless lively heat, still to endure,
And grew a seething bath, which yet men prove
Against strange maladies a sovereign cure.
But at my mistress' eye Love's brand new-fired,
The boy for trial needs would touch my breast;
I, sick withal, the help of bath desired,
And thither hied, a sad distemper'd guest,
  But found no cure: the bath for my help lies
  Where Cupid got new fire -- my mistress' eyes.</pre>

Laid by his side his heart-inflaming brand,

And so the general of hot desire
Was sleeping by a virgin hand disarm'd.
This brand she quenched in a cool well by,
Which from Love's fire took heat perpetual,
Growing a bath and healthful remedy
For men diseased; but I, my mistress' thrall,
  Came there for cure, and this by that I prove,
  Love's fire heats water, water cools not love.</pre>

|Description|allow mouse interactions inside popups without automatically closing them|
Usually, when a TW popup is displayed, it is automatically closed whenever a click occurs //anywhere// in the document, either //inside// or //outside// the popup itself.  This plugin makes popups persistent (a.k.a, &quot;sticky&quot;), allowing you to perform multiple mouse interactions on content //inside// the popup (e.g., entering form fields, opening links, selecting text, etc.), remaining visible until you click //outside// the popup or perform an action that opens another popup (only one popup can be displayed at any given time).
!!!!!Configuration
&lt;&lt;&lt;
You can cause popups to behave in a persistent (&quot;sticky&quot;) manner simply by selecting the option checkbox below.  The selected popup display behavior will be applied to ALL popups in the document automatically.
&gt;&lt;&lt;option chkStickyPopups&gt;&gt; make all popups &quot;sticky&quot;
&gt;{{{usage: &lt;&lt;option chkStickyPopups&gt;&gt;}}}
&lt;&lt;&lt;
!!!!!Usage
&lt;&lt;&lt;
If you are developing your own plugins or inline scripts that create popups programmatically using the core function:
{{{
Popup.create(this)
}}}
you can provide additional parameters that specify the desired CSS classname(s) to assign to the popup DOM element.  The default class when none is specified is simply &quot;popup&quot;.  To create a //sticky// popup, simply enter a custom class combination like this:
{{{
Popup.create(this,null,&quot;sticky popup&quot;)
}}}
&lt;&lt;&lt;
!!!!!Revisions

&lt;&lt;&lt;
{{{&lt;&lt;tiddlerTweaker&gt;&gt;}}}
{{smallform{&lt;&lt;tiddlerTweaker&gt;&gt;}}}
By default, any tags you enter into the TiddlerTweaker will //replace// the existing tags in all the tiddlers you have selected.  However, you can also use TiddlerTweaker to quickly filter specified tags from the selected tiddlers, while leaving any other tags assigned to those tiddlers unchanged:
&gt;Any tag preceded by a '+' (plus) or '-' (minus), will be added or removed from the existing tags //instead of replacing the entire tag definition// of each tiddler (e.g., enter '-excludeLists' to remove that tag from all selected tiddlers.  When using this syntax, care should be taken to ensure that //every// tag is preceded by '+' or '-', to avoid inadvertently overwriting any other existing tags on the selected tiddlers.  (note: the '+' or '-' prefix on each tag value is NOT part of the tag value, and is only used by TiddlerTweaker to control how that tag value is processed)
Important Notes:
* TiddlerTweaker is a 'power user' tool that can make changes to many tiddlers at once.  ''You should always have a recent backup of your document (or 'save changes' just *before* tweaking the tiddlers), just in case you accidentally 'shoot yourself in the foot'.''
* The date and author information on any tiddlers you tweak will ONLY be updated if the corresponding checkboxes have been selected.  As a general rule, after using TiddlerTweaker, always ''//remember to save your document//'' when you are done, even though the tiddler timeline tab may not show any recently modified tiddlers.
* Selecting and updating all tiddlers in a document can take a while.  Your browser may warn about an 'unresponsive script'.  Usually, if you allow it to continue, it should complete the processing... eventually.  Nonetheless, be sure to save your work before you begin tweaking lots of tiddlers, just in case something does get stuck.

|Name|UnsavedChangesPlugin|
|Source|http://www.TiddlyTools.com/#UnsavedChangesPlugin|

|Type|plugin|
|Description|show droplist of tiddlers that have changed since the last time the document was saved|
Display a list of tiddlers that have been changed since the last time the document was saved.  The list includes all new/modified tiddlers as well as those changed with &quot;minor edits&quot; enabled and any tiddlers that you import during the session, regardless of their modification date.
!!!!!Usage
&lt;&lt;&lt;
{{{
&lt;&lt;unsavedChanges panel&gt;&gt; or &lt;&lt;unsavedChanges&gt;&gt;
}}}
{{indent{
the ''panel'' keyword displays a 'control panel' interface containing a droplist of unsaved tiddlers and a 'goto' button, along with a command link to 'save changes'.  Depending upon what other plugins are installed, several additional elements will also be displayed: When [[NestedSlidersPlugin]] is installed, the entire control panel is contained within a ''SLIDER''.  When [[LoadTiddlersPlugin]] is installed, a ''REVERT'' button is added.  When [[SaveAsPlugin]] is installed, a ''SAVE AS'' link is added.  When [[UploadPlugin]] is installed, an ''UPLOAD'' (or ''save to web'') link is added.  When [[TrashPlugin]] is installed and there are tiddlers tagged with&lt;&lt;tag Trash&gt;&gt;, an ''EMPTY TRASH'' link is added.
}}}
{{{
&lt;&lt;unsavedChanges list separator&gt;&gt;
}}}
{{indent{
the ''list'' keyword displays a simple space-separated list of unsaved tiddlers without any other command links.  You can specify an optional ''separator'' value that can be used in place of the default space character.  For example, you can specify {{{&quot;&lt;br&gt;&quot;}}} as the separator in order to display each link, one per line.
}}}
{{{
&lt;&lt;unsavedChanges command label tip&gt;&gt;
}}}
{{indent{
the ''command'' keyword displays a single 'command link' that, when clicked, displays a ~TiddlyWiki popup containing the list of unsaved tiddlers, the 'save changes' command and, depending upon what other plugins are installed, additional commands for 'save as', 'upload', and 'empty trash' (similar to the panel display described above).

You can specify optional ''label'' and ''tip'' parameters in the macro to customize the command link text and tooltip.  The default label for the command link is: &quot;There %1 %0 unsaved tiddler%2...&quot;, where:
* %0 is automatically replaced with the number of unsaved changes
* %1 is either &quot;is&quot; (if changes=1) or &quot;are&quot; (if changes&gt;1)
* %2 is either blank (if changes=1) or &quot;s&quot; (if changes&gt;1)
resulting in the text: //&quot;There is 1 unsaved tiddler...&quot;, &quot;There are 2 unsaved tiddlers...&quot;, etc.//
}}}
&lt;&lt;&lt;
!!!!!Examples
&lt;&lt;&lt;
^^//note: the following examples will not display any output unless you have already created/modified tiddlers in the current document.//^^

&lt;&lt;unsavedChanges list &quot;&lt;br&gt;&quot;&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;&lt;
!!!!!Revisions
&lt;&lt;&lt;
2009.03.02 [3.3.3] fix handling for titles that contain HTML special chars (lt,gt,quot,amp)
2008.09.02 [3.3.2] cleanup popup list output generation and added timestamps/sizes to popup display
2008.08.23 [3.3.1] added optional custom 'label' and 'tip' params to 'command' mode and defined default values for mode, label, tip, and separator as object properties for I18N/L10N-readiness.
2008.08.21 [3.3.0] complete re-write of rendering and refresh processing to support multiple instances and automatic self-refresh (no longer depends upon core refresh notifications)
2008.08.21 [3.2.0] added 'command' option for link+popup as alternative to 'control panel' interface
2008.04.22 [3.1.2] use SaveAsPlugin instead of obsolete NewDocumentPlugin to add &quot;save as&quot; link
2007.12.22 [3.1.1] hijack removeTiddler() instead of low-level deleteTiddler() to correct tracking and refresh handling issues.  in saveTiddler(), check for 'tiddler rename' (title!=newtitle) and adjust list accordingly.
2007.12.21 [3.1.0] added support for {{{&lt;&lt;unsavedChanges list separator&gt;&gt;}}} usage to unsaved tiddlers as a simple list of links, embedded in tiddler content (e.g., [[MainMenu]])
2007.12.20 [3.0.0] rewrite to track ALL changed tiddlers, including imports and minor edits, regardless of saved modification dates.  Also, rewrote display logic to directly refresh macro output instead of triggering a page refresh.  The entire process is MUCH more efficient now.
2007.08.02 [2.0.0] converted from inline script
2007.01.01 [1.0.0] initial release
